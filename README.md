# Module-4_Deliverable
## Analysis: Here are my 2 analyses that I found interesting:
### 1) Charter schools tend to test better in math than public schools despite having a smaller budget.
### 2) There is a great variety of student population among the selected high schools.

## Potential future analysis:
### 1) Compare test performance on a grade-by-grade basis for both math and reading between Public and Charter schools.
### 2) Compare the test performance in reading for high performers on the math test, and the test performance in math for high performers on the reading test.
